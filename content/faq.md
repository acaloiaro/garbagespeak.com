## What are the rules for thought leaders posting new garbage speak?

You can post any garbage speak seen in the wild, so long as it is not embellished and does not identify any individuals or companies.

Garbage speak suspected of embellishment will be removed.

If the garbage speak is _not_ proprietary, e.g. an internal company Slack conversation, we encourage users to add URLs any content.

## Do I need to sign up to anything to become a thought leader?

Currently, no. But we may require registration in the future to combat spam / ensure that repeat embellishment offenders don't abuse the system.

## What's the go-to-market for future features?

TBD -- we're thinking about adding a leader board for top trash. Only registered users will be eligible for the leader board.
